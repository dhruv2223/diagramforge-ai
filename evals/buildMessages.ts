// Helpers for turning a golden test case into the ModelMessage[] history that
// gets fed to the agent. Create cases are trivial (one user turn). Modify
// cases need a fake prior conversation: the original user request, the
// agent's tool call producing seed elements, the matching tool result, the
// agent's confirmation, then the new user turn that asks for a modification.
//
// The whole point is the agent should not be able to tell the difference
// between this fake history and a real session it lived through.
